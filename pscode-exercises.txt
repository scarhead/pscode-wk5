// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

int num
if num == 0
print num is even
else if num == 1
print num is odd
else print error

creating a new int called "num" for number
then checks to see if the number is even number
if the num isnt then checks to see if it's odd
otherwise it will display an error

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

int num1, num2, num3, num4, num5
int sum, sum2
input "Enter five different numbers"

num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5 = sum //b
sum / 5 = sum2

print "The average of all five numbers are %sum2"

if num1 max // c
print "num1 is the largest"
else if num1 min
print "num1 is the smallest"
else
print "num1 is neither the biggest or smallest"

if num2 max
print "num2 is the largest"
else if num2 min
print "num2 is the smallest"
else
print "num2 is neither the biggest or smallest"

if num3 max
print "num3 is the largest"
else if num3 min
print "num3 is the smallest"
else
print "num3 is neither the biggest or smallest"

if num4 max
print "num4 is the largest"
else if num4min
print "num4 is the smallest"
else 
print "num4 is neither the biggest or smallest"

if num5 max
print "num5 is the largest"
else if num5 min
print "num5 is the smallest"
else
print "num5 is neither the biggest or smallest"


B. The 5 different numbers that are being add are total together using the int sum
After all of the numbers are added together they're then divided by 5 which then gives the average

C. The 5 numbers are then used in a if else statment to figured out which one is the biggest or smallest 
It first checks to see if the numbers are the largest if it is then it will print out that it is the largest
However if it's not then it moves on to the next else if statement which prints that it's the smallest
if none of the numbers are biggest or smallest then it will print out that neither are the biggest or smallest.
